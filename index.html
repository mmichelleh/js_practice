            I'm an accounting major student. 
I proactively engage with potential clients to assess insurance needs and recommend appropriate coverage options. Dedicated and results-oriented Sales Associate with a proven track record in the insurance industry. Seeking to leverage exceptional sales skills, customer relationship management, and extensive product knowledge to drive revenue growth and provide excellent service at Statefarm. I develop and maintain strong client relationships through effective communication, follow-ups, and personalized service. I also collaborate with the sales team to meet and exceed monthly and quarterly sales targets. 
          I graduated from Glendale Community College with a Business Administration Associate degree.                    
          My career interest is to become an exceptional accountant and help those who need my services. I plan to also spread my knowledge with others and help them become experts in the field. I think this career is one that is always going to be needed for people in keeping their finances organized.
